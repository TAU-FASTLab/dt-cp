# About DT-CP

The Digital Twin for planning and control (DT-CP) allows the users to create a virtual replica of the production line facilitated by the use case. The component is divided into two parts: A simulator, to experiment with alternative models to be implemented in the real line, and a monitoring dashboard for having an overview of the line.

The time-based simulator takes as input several configuration parameters (e.g., takt time, shift time), process descriptions and resources (e.g., workers) with different skill set. Hence the user can modify and test different production strategies that would be more complicated and time consuming to test in the real line. The monitoring dashboard can provide the user with an overview on the status of production and provide notification mechanism for alerts when implemented.
